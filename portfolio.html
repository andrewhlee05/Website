The user has three lives and loses one whenever they catch a bomb. They have the option to choose between two songs and to play again if they lose all three lives. A lot of color and movement is involved with this game and functions that reduce the duplication of code. There are responses to events that occur, along with list indexing for the leaderboard.</font> </h1>

	<h1> This project shows the total honey value per year and average honey producers in different states over a course of time. This data is from the USDA and the graphs label the states to represent the relationship of the data through the years. These graphs help give an understanding of how honey production and the value of it has drastically changed in some states. </h1>

	<h1> This presentation my partners and I created explains the simulation model of bees searching for a hive. The model shows the proccess of the bees going to different hives and returning to their swarm where they create a dance path for other bees to travel to the hive they found. The model lets the user change the number of hives, the explore time of the bees, and the minimum number of bees exploring. The only turtles used in this simulation are the bees and the hives. Our group concluded that we should help increase the productivity and effiency of bees.
