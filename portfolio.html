	<h1><font size="4"> This game's objective is for the user to play as the minion and catch the bananas falling and avoid the bombs from the sky. The user has three lives and loses one whenever they catch a bomb. They have the option to choose between two songs and to play again if they lose all three lives. A lot of color and movement is involved with this game and functions that reduce the duplication of code.
